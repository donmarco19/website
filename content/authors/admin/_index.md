My name is Don Marco (Marco) Loleng. I recently earned my Bachelor's degree, graduating *cum laude* with highest departmental distinction in Statistics and Computer Science in May 2020.

I started this blog to track and reflect upon my personal learning and development. I plan to post my learnings, personal goals, projects, etc. in both technical and non-technical subjects- essentially treating this as my own personal outlet.

I live in the Chicago suburbs, and am currently filling my free time by learning data science concepts, producing music, DJing, and playing video games.
